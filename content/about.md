# Iowa Radio Operators (IRO)

The Iowa Radio Operators (IRO) began as a dream—a vision of a space where radio operators of all disciplines could come together to support one another. Inspired by the TOADs and Ham Radio Clubhouse Discord communities, this vision became reality on August 19th, 2022, when Ben Jutting (K0BJJ) founded the Iowa Radio Operators Discord. Shortly after, Jason Loher (KD0MUB) joined as a co-founding member. Through dedicated outreach and promotion, IRO quickly established itself as the go-to online hub for Iowa radio operators, providing a place where members could collaborate on projects and troubleshoot challenges.

From the outset, Jason (KD0MUB) proposed the idea of transforming IRO into an official club. At the time, both he and Ben had distanced themselves from the local Amateur Radio Association in the town where he lived. Ben remained hesitant, wary of bringing any organizational drama into IRO. However, in September 2024, Calvin Jutting (KN0CTJ) revisited the idea, prompting Ben to reconsider. With renewed perspective, the IRO Club was born.

Just as the Discord was founded to welcome all, the club embraces that same philosophy—it exists for those seeking a different kind of organization or for individuals who simply want a club to call their own. The IRO Club reinforces the strong sense of community that has always been at its core.
