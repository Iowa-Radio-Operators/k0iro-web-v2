## Membership to K0IRO - Iowa Radio Operators

We’re excited that you’re considering joining a statewide community built for radio enthusiasts of all backgrounds. K0IRO exists to provide a welcoming space for operators to connect, especially in areas where a local club isn’t available or where gathering opportunities are limited. Our goal is simple: create a supportive, accessible, and engaging environment for amateur radio operators across Iowa.

Before applying, we encourage you to explore a few key pages that explain who we are and what we stand for:

* [About Us](https://k0iro.com/about/)  
* [Mission & Vision](https://k0iro.com/about/mission-vision/)  
* [Club Charter & Bylaws](https://k0iro.com/about/bylaws/)

These documents outline our purpose, values, and the framework that guides our club.

**A Note About Membership Dues**

At this time, we are not yet set up to accept dues payments — and that’s perfectly fine. As a new organization, our officers are finalizing the administrative details behind the scenes. When everything is ready, we’ll reach out to early members to complete the dues process.

Please note that the IRO Discord server will **always be free to use** and will remain **separate from club membership**. Participation in the IRO Discord does not require paying dues, and everyone is welcome to join the conversation.

**How To Apply**

We have chosen to use HamClubOnline for their online platform with rich feature sets for members, collecting dues, voting, skill sets and asset management. You will need to register for an account as an individual first.
