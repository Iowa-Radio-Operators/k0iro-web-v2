Iowa Radio Operators Radio Club fosters a statewide community of radio enthusiasts by providing education, collaboration, and resources for operators who may not have access to a local club. We strive to connect, support, and grow the amateur radio community in Iowa while partnering with existing clubs to enhance the shared experience of learning and communication.

## Vision Statement

To be a unifying hub for radio operators across Iowa, promoting knowledge-sharing, technical innovation, and a strong sense of community. We envision a network of operators working together to advance the craft, support local clubs, and create opportunities for growth and engagement in amateur radio.
