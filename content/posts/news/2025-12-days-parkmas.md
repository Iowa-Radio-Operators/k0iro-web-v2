# KOIRO 12 Days of Park-mas - Contest Rules

## Introduction
Activating in the parks is what keeps POTA alive — it gets radios into the outdoors, shows the hobby to the public, and builds skills. But none of it works without hunters at home; every QSO from the shack makes activations possible. This contest celebrates both sides: the activators braving the parks and the hunters who keep them connected.
