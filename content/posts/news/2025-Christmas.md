# Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from K0IRO

As we wrap up the year, thank you to everyone who makes this community such a great place to talk, learn, and share all things radio. From amateur radio, gmrs and cb to meshtastic, emcom, and everything in between, your questions, projects, and conversations keep the airwaves alive.

We hope you have a safe and relaxing Christmas with time to enjoy family, friends, and maybe even a little time on the radio. Best wishes for a happy holiday season and clear signals in the year ahead.
