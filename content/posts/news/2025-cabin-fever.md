## DMRAA Cabin Fever Reliever

After weeks of winter hibernation, it’s time to shake off the cabin fever and reconnect with the people who make amateur radio in Iowa so special. Whether you’re a seasoned operator, a curious newcomer, or just someone who loves good coffee and better conversation, this is your chance to jumpstart the year with energy, gear, and camaraderie.


Join us for the Cabin Fever Reliever Amateur Radio Social & Swap Meet

📍 Fort Des Moines Museum and Education Center
🗓️ Saturday, January 17th, 2026
⏰ 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM

Expect tables full of radio parts, antennas, and gear ready to buy, sell, or trade. Bring your extras, your wish list, and your stories—because this isn’t just about equipment, it’s about community. There’ll be donuts, coffee, and plenty of friendly faces ready to swap ideas, troubleshoot setups, and share what they’ve been working on through the winter months.

Let’s kick off 2026 with a strong signal and stronger connections. See you there
