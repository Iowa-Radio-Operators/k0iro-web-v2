Sorry it's been a while since our last post. Life for the leaders of the club has just gotten busy. Not excuses, just unfortunate where we find time. It got me thinking... One of the joys still out there at is the ability to join nets and check-in, some of them are rag chew style nets and good to just share what’s going on. I tried to the best of my searching luck to put together a list of local nets!

If you have any other nets and would like this list updated I would love to create a section of the website to be able to share these out state wide. Email me directly or send a note with your net date time and details to [info@k0iro.com](info@k0iro.com)
