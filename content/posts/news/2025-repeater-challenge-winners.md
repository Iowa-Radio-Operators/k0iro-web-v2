# Congratulations to the Winners

I want to personally thank everyone who participated in the **Iowa Radio Operators – 2025 Repeater Challenge**. Over the six‑month challenge, we recorded an impressive **795 logged entries**, which is a testament to the enthusiasm and dedication of this community.

Our first‑ and second‑place finishers truly went the extra mile, utilizing both Amateur Radio and GMRS to reach their goals—excellent examples of skill, creativity, and persistence. Well done!

A huge thank‑you also goes out to everyone who took the time to log their QSOs. Your participation is what made this challenge such a success. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to seeing even more activity next time!
