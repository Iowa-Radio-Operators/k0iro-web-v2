## A Quick Look Ahead: Introducing ASL Hub1

K0IRO is excited to announce that **ASL Hub1 is now live and available for use across Iowa**. This is the first statewide AllStar hub built specifically to support communication, collaboration, and emergency readiness for repeater owners and operators throughout the state.

Hub1 is designed to be a shared meeting point — a place where local repeaters can link in, where operators can gather for statewide conversation, and where emergency services can rely on a stable, well‑managed resource when coordination matters most.

In addition to serving as a central hub, Hub1 also operates as a **voter**, allowing multiple receivers across Iowa to feed into a single, clean audio path. This ensures wide coverage, clear audio, and a fair opportunity for everyone to be heard during nets, events, or emergency traffic.

Hub1 is available now as **ASL Node 656839**, and we’re excited to welcome repeater groups who want to participate. If you’d like details on how to connect your AllStar node to the voter, or if you want help determining the best way to link your repeater, reach out anytime at **info@k0iro.com**.
