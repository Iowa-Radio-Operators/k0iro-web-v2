# **K0IRO Leadership Update:**

The Iowa Radio Operators (K0IRO) leadership team has been actively working to establish a new amateur radio club that will serve radio enthusiasts across the entire state of Iowa. While we’re preparing for our first member meeting, we wanted to share a progress update on our foundational efforts, key decisions, and upcoming initiatives. This post outlines what we’ve accomplished so far—and how you can help shape the club’s future.
