# The Quiet Power of QRP: Why Low‑Power Operating Is Having a Moment

If you’ve been around the hobby lately, you’ve probably noticed a trend: more and more operators are picking up QRP rigs. Some are brand‑new to low‑power operating, others are rediscovering the fun after years on the higher‑wattage side of the dial. Either way, the spark is catching — and there’s no better example than the weekly QRP livestream hosted by Iowa’s own Kevin, **K0KLB**, and Steve, **K04GSM**.

Every Sunday, they fire up their tiny rigs and ask the question that defines the whole QRP spirit: **“How low can you go?”** It’s part challenge, part experiment, part celebration of what makes amateur radio such a unique and endlessly surprising hobby.

## Why QRP Is Capturing So Much Attention

QRP isn’t about brute force. It’s not about being the loudest signal on the band or the biggest station on the block. It’s about finesse — understanding your antenna, reading the band conditions, and squeezing every bit of performance out of a handful of watts.

And that’s exactly why so many operators are falling in love with it.

- **It’s accessible.** A QRP rig can fit in a backpack, a glovebox, or the palm of your hand.  
- **It’s skill‑building.** You learn quickly what matters: timing, antennas, propagation, and patience.  
- **It’s portable fun.** Parks, trails, backyards, picnic tables — QRP thrives anywhere.  
- **It’s budget‑friendly.** You don’t need a tower or a kilowatt to have a great time.  
- **It’s rewarding.** When you make a contact on 5 watts, you *feel* it.

There’s something undeniably satisfying about hearing your call come back from hundreds or thousands of miles away when you’re running power levels that barely warm the finals.

## The Sunday QRP Net: A Community in Action

Kevin and Steve’s livestream has become a gathering place for operators who want to push their gear, test their antennas, or simply enjoy the camaraderie of low‑power radio. It’s relaxed, friendly, and full of the kind of experimentation that keeps the hobby alive.

Some nights the bands cooperate. Some nights they don’t.  
But that’s part of the charm — QRP makes every QSO a small adventure.

And tonight, Iowa is showing up strong. Operators across the state are tuning in, calling in, and proving that you don’t need big power to make big connections.

## Thinking About Trying QRP?

If you’ve got a QRP rig sitting on the shelf, this is your sign to dust it off. If you’ve been curious about low‑power operating but haven’t taken the plunge, the Sunday net is the perfect place to start. You’ll find encouragement, inspiration, and a whole community cheering you on.

QRP reminds us why we got into amateur radio in the first place:  
the challenge, the creativity, the experimentation, and the joy of making something simple work beautifully.

So tune in, listen in, or jump in.  
See how low you can go — and how far your signal can carry.
